excerpt: 'Hospital staffing often uses contengency staff who are on-call and can be called on short notice. Such contingency staffing allows staff planners to react to changes in demand without relying solely on overtime. This is advantageous as overtime in clinical setting is often associated with poor clinical outcomes, poor employee health, and increased employe turnover rates. However, the use of contingency staffing introduces unpredictability for the employees. A model based solution to staff planning should incorporate the inconvenience costs of this unpredictability. We use data from the anesthesiologist staff planning at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center to first estimate the implicit costs of on-cal staffing. We find that the cost of not calling an anesthesiologist on the on-call list is 56% more than the cost of actually calling the anesthesiologists. Also, the cost of idle time for anesthesiologists was 94% more than the cost of overtime. We use these estimated cost parameters in a two-stage integer stochastic dynamic programming model of staff planning. We develop structural properties of this model and use them in a sample average approximation algorithm constructed to solve this problem. Our model shows the potential to reduce overall costs by 13%. We also provide managerial insights related to hiring decisions by specialty, sensitivity to cost parameters, and improvements in prediction of booked time durations.'
