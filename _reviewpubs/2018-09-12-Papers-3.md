At large hospitals, the assignment and scheduling of anesthesiologists and operating rooms is a complex resource allocation decision undertaken daily by the managers of operating room suites. We validate and implement a data-driven decision support system at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center which provides a near-optimal schedule. We also conduct analyses related to capacity expansion and process improvement efforts.
