2015-03-20	Planning for HIV Screening, Testing, and Care at the Veterans Health Administration	Operations Research	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a routine screening policy for HIV. We combine models of disease progression and the system dynamics at the Greater Los Angeles station of the Veterans Health Administration and find that routine screening may not be always feasible. We applied this model and used it to develop and evaluate managerially relevant policies within existent capacity and budgetary constraints to improve upon the current screening policy.

2017-07-20	Paper Title Number 2	Integrated Anesthesiologist and Room Scheduling for Surgeries: Methodology and Application	At large hospitals, the assignment and scheduling of anesthesiologists and operating rooms is a complex resource allocation decision undertaken daily by the managers of operating room suites. We validate and implement a data-driven decision support system at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center which provides a near-optimal schedule. We also conduct analyses related to capacity expansion and process improvement efforts.	Rath, S., Rajaram, K., & Mahajan, A. (2017).
