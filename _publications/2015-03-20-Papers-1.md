title: "Planning for HIV Screening, Testing, and Care at the Veterans Health Administration"
collection: publications
permalink:
excerpt: 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a routine screening policy for HIV. We combine models of disease progression and the system dynamics at the Greater Los Angeles station of the Veterans Health Administration and find that routine screening may not be always feasible. We applied this model and used it to develop and evaluate managerially relevant policies within existent capacity and budgetary constraints to improve upon the current screening policy.'
